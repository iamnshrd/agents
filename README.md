# Getting started

This repo is inteded for use with Python 3.9

1. Clone the repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/{username}/polymarket-agents.git
   cd polymarket-agents
   ```

2. Create the virtual environment

   ```
   virtualenv --python=python3.9 .venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment

   - On Windows:

   ```
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set up your environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   - Add the following environment variables:

   ```
   # Core Trading
   POLYGON_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=""
   OPENAI_API_KEY=""
   
   # Telegram Integration
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=""
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=""
   
   # MCP Integration
   TAVILY_API_KEY=""
   SMITHERY_API_KEY=""
   
   # Trading Configuration (dry-run)
   TRADING_MODE=dry_run
   DRY_RUN_BALANCE=100000   # cents ‚Üí $1000.00
   MAX_POSITION_SIZE=0.10   # 10% –æ—Ç –±–∞–ª–∞–Ω—Å–∞ –Ω–∞ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∫—É (–∫–ª–∞–º–ø)
   RISK_PER_TRADE=0.02      # –±–∞–∑–æ–≤—ã–π —Ä–∏—Å–∫, –≤–ª–∏—è–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—Ä –ø–æ–∑–∏—Ü–∏–∏
   ```

6. Load your wallet with USDC.

7. Try the command line interface...

   ```
   python scripts/python/cli.py
   ```

   Or just go trade! 

   ```
   # Single dry-run trade
   python -m agents.application.dry_run_trader

   # Continuous dry-run session (edit __main__ or call from CLI soon)
   # Example (Python REPL):
   # from agents.application.dry_run_trader import DryRunTrader
   # t = DryRunTrader(); t.run_session(num_trades=10, pause_secs=2.0)

   # Telegram bot (simple long-polling): commands /positions and /portfolio
   # Requires TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and (optionally) TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
   python -c "import asyncio; from agents.connectors.telegram import telegram_bot_poll; asyncio.run(telegram_bot_poll())"

## docker-compose

To run both the session trader and Telegram bot as services:

1. Build image locally:

   ```
   docker build -f Dockerfile -t polymarket-agents:latest .
   ```

2. Ensure your `.env` is in the repo root and contains required keys.

3. Start services:

   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Logs:

   ```
   docker compose logs -f session
   docker compose logs -f telegram
   tail -f logs/trading.log
   ```

   # Legacy single-step example
   python agents/application/trade.py
   ```

8. Note: If running the command outside of docker, please set the following env var:

   ```
   export PYTHONPATH="."
   ```

   If running with docker is preferred, we provide the following scripts:

   ```
   ./scripts/bash/build-docker.sh
   ./scripts/bash/run-docker-dev.sh
   ```

## Architecture

The Polymarket Agents architecture features modular components that can be maintained and extended by individual community members.

### APIs & Connectors

Polymarket Agents connectors standardize data sources and order types.

- **`Chroma.py`**: ChromaDB for vectorizing news sources and other API data. Developers can add their own vector database implementations.

- **`Gamma.py`**: Defines `GammaMarketClient` class, which interfaces with the Polymarket Gamma API to fetch and parse market and event metadata. Methods to retrieve current and tradable markets, as well as defined information on specific markets and events.

- **`Polymarket.py`**: Defines a Polymarket class that interacts with the Polymarket API to retrieve and manage market and event data, and to execute orders on the Polymarket DEX. Includes methods for API key initialization, market and event data retrieval, and trade execution.

- **`Objects.py`**: Data models using Pydantic; representations for trades, markets, events, and related entities.

### **New MCP Connectors**

- **`tavily_mcp.py`**: Tavily MCP client for web search, data extraction, sentiment analysis, and market research.

- **`verge_news_mcp.py`**: The Verge News MCP client via Smithery for high-quality technology news and market insights.

- **`telegram.py`**: Telegram integration for real-time trading alerts, position updates, and market notifications.

### **Enhanced Trading Modules**

- **`enhanced_dry_run_trader.py`**: Advanced dry-run trader with MCP integration for market analysis and news sentiment.

- **`trading_config.py`**: Centralized configuration management for all trading parameters and MCP settings.

- **`trading_logger.py`**: Comprehensive logging system for trades, performance, and system events.

- **`performance_analyzer.py`**: Advanced analytics for trading performance, including PnL, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown analysis.

### Scripts

Files for managing your local environment, server set-up to run the application remotely, and cli for end-user commands.

`cli.py` is the primary user interface for the repo. Users can run various commands to interact with the Polymarket API, retrieve relevant news articles, query local data, send data/prompts to LLMs, and execute trades in Polymarkets.
